Types of common logic building exercises

1. Total or algebraic sum operaion
    i- Create an initial total variable with initial as 0
    ii- for each item to be added in the total, do the following
        - fetch the item
        - add the item to the sum
        - update the sum
    iii- return the final sum


2. Find Min value from a collection
    eg -find lowest (minimum) integer from an array
    i- create an initial min which MUST be equal to the first item from the collection
    ii- for each item in the collection, do the following 
        - fetch the item
        - compare item with "MIN_VALUE" so far.
            - if current item is larger then MIN_VALUE, "ignore"
            - if the current item is smaller, update MIN_VALUE as "current item"
    iii- Finally, the MIN_VALUE now holds the "global minima".

3. Find an attribute associated with the min value object
    eg - finding the car with min mileage and returning this mileage
    i- create an initial min which MUST be equal to the first item from the collection
    ii- also save the attribute (to be returned) of the first item
    iii- for each object, do the following
        - compare and checkwhether current val is lower than min  
         -> if yes, update min, update associated value
         -> if no, ignore
    iv- return the associated value
