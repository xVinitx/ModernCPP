# memory (primary memory/ RAM)
# SoC CHIP (everything including memory on the same physical device)

Objectives:
    1. Concurrency: Ability to context switching between
    running tasks to achieve better performance (concurrent exeute)

    2. Parallelism: Doing more than one action AT THE SAME MOMENT IN TIME
                    BASED ON HARDWARE AVAILABILITY 
    
    3. Learn about lock-based synchronization primitives
        a. MUTEX
        b. SEMAPHORE
        c. RECURSIVE LOCKING
        d. CONDITIONAL LOCKING
        e. SCOPE_BASED LOCKING (BASED ON RAII PRINCIPLE)

    4. Algebric data types in Modern C++
        - Optional
        - Variant (functional polymorphism)
        - any
    
    5. Learn some behind-the-scenes optimzation techniques
         - guaranteed copy elision
         - constexpr
    
    6. if & switch initializers

    7. structured binding


Regarding systems

    1. Memory (primary memory or RAM)
    2. Processing hardware unit (intel ya AMD ya Apple silicon device)
